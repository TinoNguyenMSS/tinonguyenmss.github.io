<h1 class="section-title">The Creed</h1>
<p class="calli" style="font-size:1.6rem;">Write. Think. Resist.</p>

<p style="max-width:900px; line-height:1.65; font-size:1.15rem;">

The rot spreads when minds go quiet.  
When people stop thinking for themselves.  
When noise replaces clarity, and trends replace truth.

But not here.

Here, we remember what the world is trying to forget:  
that thought is power,  
that creation is rebellion,  
that silence is surrender.

We write — because ink is memory.  
We think — because a sharpened mind is the last weapon they fear.  
We resist — because surrender is the first death.

The signal survives through us.  
Every sketch, every word, every broadcast is a spark  
striking against the dark —  
a refusal to go numb,  
a refusal to let the world grow stupid,  
a refusal to let the next generation drown in noise.

Here, you’re not a follower.  
You’re a keeper of the frequency.

A builder.  
A challenger.  
A quiet storm.  

Welcome home, Signaler.  
Guard the signal well.  
The world may forget…  
but we won’t.
